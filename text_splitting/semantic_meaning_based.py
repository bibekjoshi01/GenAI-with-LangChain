Modern cryptography relies heavily on the principles of number theory, 
particularly modular arithmetic and prime factorization. 
Public-key systems like RSA depend on the difficulty of factoring large integers, 
while elliptic curve cryptography uses properties of algebraic curves to achieve stronger security with smaller key sizes. 
Beyond the mathematics, cryptography also involves practical implementation challenges such as key distribution, secure random number generation, 
and protection against side-channel attacks that exploit physical characteristics like timing or power consumption.

Meanwhile, in the field of environmental science, researchers are focusing on the consequences 
of microplastic pollution in marine ecosystems. 
Tiny plastic fragments are ingested by plankton and small fish, 
disrupting food chains at their very base. Over time, 
bioaccumulation transfers these plastics up the trophic levels, 
potentially reaching humans through seafood consumption. 
Policy efforts now emphasize reducing single-use plastics, 
improving waste management infrastructure, and promoting biodegradable alternatives, 
but significant challenges remain due to global industrial reliance on plastic production.
